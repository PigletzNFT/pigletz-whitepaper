## ERC721

NFT or Non Fungible Token is a token living in the blockchain, described by s Smart Contract following the [ERC721 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).&#x20;

Each NFT has usually two parts:

* Blockchain part - smart contract, describing the NFT as ERC721 token with a limited supply, allowing minting and transfers of the tokens etc.
* Meta Data - text information combined with media data that is the actual representation of the NFT, the one the user sees/hears/... .

Pigletz resides at the moment in the [Binance Smart Chain blokchain](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/). Its contract can be found at the following address: [0xbF84076b06a100d38ce562733098eDc0eDa4D7f7](https://bscscan.com/address/0xbf84076b06a100d38ce562733098edc0eda4d7f7#code)

The contract utilizes the [OpenZeppelin ](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/)framework which is a de facto standard for EVM compatible blockchains.

The meta data if the Pigletz is uploaded to the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) which gives higher level of decentralization and security to our users. For example the first minted piglet #4041 can be found here: [https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZ88agv3zymNctxFtraparboWZ8o2jSxV6T6XnFThYVBJ](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZ88agv3zymNctxFtraparboWZ8o2jSxV6T6XnFThYVBJ)
