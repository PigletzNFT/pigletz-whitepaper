# Materialization

Pigletz introduces a novel protocol allowing NFTs to jump from the digital world (Metaverse) to the real world and vice versa.&#x20;

This is possible only on level 3. In order to materialize a Piglet its owner needs to lock it into a Bridge contract and set a password #1. Then he needs to send us his shipping info (address, etc.). Then we will produce a high quality 3D print which is later processed, polished and colored. Then we will ship the Physical piglet to its owner. Inside of the Piglet we put a password #2 that will be used to unlock the NFT from the Bridge contract.&#x20;

The NFT part will remain locked until someone provides password #1 and #2 to the Bridge contract.&#x20;

This protocol allows only a single copy of the NFT to exist either in the digital world as a NFT or as a real physical object.&#x20;

In order to take out the passwords the owner of the physical object needs to destroy it, for example with a hammer. Then the owner can pullout the codes and use them to unlock the NFT.

This model will open new market opportunities for NFTs, for example selling them on eBay.
