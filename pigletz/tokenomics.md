# Tokenomics

Each piglet mints internal PiFi token every 24 hours.

The amount minted is calculated by the formula

$$
mint_{24h} = mint_{base} \times \sum{boosters}
$$

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="number">Level</th><th data-type="number">Base Mint</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>167</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>500</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Cap

Each Piglet has a cap of the total possible PiFi tokens to be minted which is 2,000,000 PiFi.

Getting into an account that the total supply of all Pigletz is 12,345 the max supply of the PiFi token will be:

$$
12,345 \times 2,000,000 = 24,690,000,000
