# Metaverse

_<mark style="color:orange;">This section is still under development and describes general ideas we have about the evolution of the Pigletz project.</mark>_

As a final step we want to create a a virtual world where our Pigletz can have a real life. Actually we  want to create a bridge between our physical world and this virtual world. Something similar to the Hyper Reality shown below:

Hyper Reality Example

In the first version of our world the Piglet will be the main character. Each user having a piglet can use it features in the virtual world. This includes boosters, tokens etc.&#x20;

Interactions between players (and their Pigletz) will be an important element of this world.&#x20;

Finally we have plans to open our world to other Metaverses and projects thus becoming an universal bridge between the metaverses and the real world.
